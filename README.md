# GLOBAL-TECH-GADGET-CONSUMPTION-ANALYSIS-2024
Globally, mobile devices have become an addiction for people, craving higher and higher specifications and durability. In this project, I analysed the different tech.. Companies and demands for different mobile-based specifications and to fine-tune which special feature mostly influences usersâ€™ choice, here are the insights below:

Dataset and Methodologies:

This data was downloaded in an Excel range table, presented in rows and columns, and this was transformed into a standard Excel Table for easy manipulation and proper presentation.

Standard Excel Table
The data, with the use of a pivot table, was visualized and a dashboard created as a summary of the visuals.

Pre-Analysis; Project split:

Independent data: Country

Dependent data: Smartphone Sales (Millions), Laptop Shipments (Millions), Gaming Console Adoption (%), Smartwatch Penetration (%), Average Consumer Spending on Gadgets ($), E-Waste Generated (Metric Tons), 5G Penetration Rate (%), and Year.

Industry Type: Technological devices

Stakeholders: Directors, Managers, Chief Executives

Story of Data: The data tells us the sales of tech gadgets in different countries, mobile phone smart, laptops, games, 5G network strength, the year and average consumer spending on gadgets.

Success in this Industry: This industry considers revenue and introduction of advanced tech as success, alongside dominating new countries in sales.

Analysis Recommendations:
After careful observations, here are my recommendations for this industry:

1. China is recommended for more bonuses following her performance in the year under review.

2. Recommendation after analysis and observation of the waste generated by the different year is that recycling factory be established in the UK.

4. It is also recommended that a tech warehouse be established in the UK and further steps be taken to grow the USA market and possibly implement the policies introduced in the UK.

5. Recommendation is that the ales principles established in the year 2021 be established or re-introduced if abolished already.

Conclusions:

Based on my analysis, the Average Consumer Spending on technological gadgets $88014.19, Leading smartphones by Country generated $3697.6 and Country Spending on technological gadgets stand at $95159.22. Subsequent research should include purpose of gadgets procurement for both individuals and countries because this will help them in budgeting.
